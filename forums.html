                <h2 class="h2Forums">Server Rules</h2>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Cursing in chat; Value 1 Strike; It is very unprofessional as a Staff Member to cuss in the global chat</li>
                            <li>Insulting a player; Value 1 or 2 Strikes; Insulting a player is an essential server rule, it's more than unprofessional it's disrespectful to a player that could not ever come back on the server just because of that, we will not tolerate it.</li>
                            <li>Banning, temp banning, muting, kicking without a GOOD reason or a 'joke' reason such as ''ey guys join play.ugottrolledby.Me''; As a staff member, we expect you to understand jokes. Value 1 Strike</li>
                            <li>Arguing with a staff member higher or lower grade in the global chat; Value 2 strikes; Again, very unprofessional.</li>
                            <li>Advertising in ANY form will result in 3 Strikes (Instant demotion)</li>
                            <li>Messing around (Tping to players, tp players to you, put blocks on their base, etc) ; Value 1 Strike ; I understand you want to have fun, But you cannot tp to players, unless they tell you to tp, and if they do, I'd ask you to go in vanish first (will be added for every staff members) and then tp, to be sure they are not in any other player's base, so player doesn't get confused and start being mean to you, etc.</li>
                            <li>GIVING stuff to players result in 2 Strikes, should be well known for staff.</li>
