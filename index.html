                    <p>I just told you! You've killed me! Pansy. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
                    <p>You can see how I lived before I met you. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. <strong> With gusto.</strong> <em> Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</em> Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>
                    <h2>Really?!</h2>
                    <p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Who are those horrible orange men? Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. With gusto.</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>I just told you! You've killed me!</li><li>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</li><li>You can see how I lived before I met you.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?</h3>
                    <p>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! When will that be? I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?</li><li>Bender?! You stole the atom.</li><li>Daylight and everything.</li>

                    <p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>
                    <p>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
                    <p>Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Okay, I like a challenge. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! What kind of a father would I be if I said no?</p>
                    <p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Bite my shiny metal ass.</p>
                    <p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
                    <p>Ow, my spirit! One hundred dollars. Throw her in the brig. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>
